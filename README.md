# teachingMoments
A collection of cyber security teaching materials.

I decided to get off the bench and start talking at my local Defcon (Glasgow DC44141) regularly with tutorials. 
I appreciate that people want to have the content after the fact so that is exactly what this is covering.

# SQL Injection

## Introduction to SQL Injection
Intro level is in SQL_Injection\Intro folder.
The slides as used in Defcon Glasgow (DC44141) are in the PDF in that folder.
The Readme.md file explains how to start the targets used during the demonstration so you can play along.
I recorded a video of content similar to what was said on the night which is on youtube <<here>>.

## Intermediate SQL Injection

...

Stay tuned, I will be covering blind SQL injection and getting shells hopefully at the March 2020 DC44141 meetup. 
If you can be in Glasgow for the live show then you are absolutely welcome. It is held on the Glasgow Caledonian University campus 
in the Student's Association building (building number 5 on the campus map). Doors open at 6:30pm, and the talks start generally at 7pm.
